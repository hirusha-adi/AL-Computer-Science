#### Syntax

```
IF A < B
THEN
 	<statement(s)>
ELSE
 	<statement(s)>
ENDIF
```

- in here, `A < B` is the condition (its a simple condition)

#### Example

```
IF Guess = SecretNumber THEN
 	OUTPUT "Well done. You have guessed the secret number"
ELSE
 	IF Guess > SecretNumber AND NumberofGuesses = 10 THEN
 		OUTPUT "You still have not guessed the secret number"
 	ELSE
 		IF Guess > SecretNumber THEN
 			OUTPUT "secret number is smaller"
 		ELSE
 			OUTPUT "secret number is greater"
 		ENDIF
 	ENDIF
ENDIF
```

- In this example, ` Guess > SecretNumber AND NumberofGuesses = 10` is a complex condition
- we can also see **Nested IF-ELSE statements**
	- conditional statements within conditional statements

| <        | Is less than            |
| >        | Is greater than         |
| <=       | Is less than or equal to|
