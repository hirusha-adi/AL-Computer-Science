## Basic Data Types

| Description | Pseudocode | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whole signed numbers | INTEGER | int |
| Signed numbers with a decimal point | REAL | float |
| A single character | CHAR | Use single (') quotation marks to delimit a character |
| A sequence of characters (a string) | STRING | Use double (") quotation marks to delimit a string |
| Logical values: True (represented as 1) and False (represented as 0) | BOOLEAN | bool (possible values: True, False) |

## Complex Data Types

| Description | Pseudocode | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Date value | DATE | Use the `datetime` class |


### NOTE:

- The result of integer division is the whole number part of the division. eg:
	- `7 DIV 2` gives `3`

- The result of the modulus operation is the remainder of a division eg:
	-  `7 MOD 2` gives `1`

# Operators
| Operation              | Pseudocode | Python |
|------------------------|------------|--------|
| Assignment | `<-` | `=` |

## Comparison Operators

| Operation              | Pseudocode | Python |
|------------------------|------------|--------|
| Equal                  | `=`        | `==`   |
| Not Equal              | `<>`       | `!=`   |
| Greater Than           | `>`        | `>`    |
| Less Than              | `<`        | `<`    |
| Greater Than or Equal To | `>=`       | `>=`   |
| Less Than or Equal To    | `<=`       | `<=`   |

## Boolean Operators

| Operation                | Pseudocode | Python |
|--------------------------|------------|--------|
| AND (logical conjunction)| `AND`      | `and`  |
| OR (logical inclusion)   | `OR`       | `or`   |
| NOT (logical negation)   | `NOT`      | `not`  |
