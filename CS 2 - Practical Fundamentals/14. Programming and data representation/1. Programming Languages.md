# Python

- Every statement must be on a separate line
- Indentation is significant. This is known as the ‘off-side rule’ (**MUST**)
- Keywords are written in lower case. 
- Python is case sensitive: 
	- the identifier `Number1` is seen as 
	- different from `number1` 
	- or `NUMBER1`
- Everything in Python is an object
- Code makes extensive use of a concept called ‘slicing’
- Programs are interpreted
	- type a statement into the Python Shell and the Python interpreter will run it
immediately
- can also type program code into a Python editor (such as IDLE), save it with a .py extension and then run the program code

## Hello  World

- use IDLE or Microsoft Visual Studio Code or VSCodium or PyCharm
-  saved as `.py`

```python
print("hello world")
```

# Visual Basic Console Mode (VB.NET)

- Every statement should be on a separate line (conventional)
- Statements can be typed on the same line with a colon (:) as a separator
- Indentation is good practice. (**NOT** a must)
- VB.NET is **not** case sensitive.
	- Modern VB.NET editors will automatically copy the case from the first definition of an identifier
- convention is to use CamelCaps for identifiers and keywords
- Programs need to be compiled

## Hello  World

- use Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual Studio
- save as `s.vb`

```vb
Module HelloWorld
    Sub Main()
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!")
    End Sub
End Module
```

# Java

- Every statement ends with a semicolon (;) (conventional)
- More than one statement can go on a single line, but this is not recommended
- Java is case sensitive.
- The convention is to use 
	- camelCaps for identifiers
	-  lower case for keywords
	-  capitalised identifiers for classes
- A compound statement consists of a sequence of statements enclosed between braces { }
- Whenever Java syntax requires a statement, a compound statement can be used
- Programs need to be compiled

## Hello  World

- use Eclipse or Netbeans
- save as `.java`

```java
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("hello world!");
	}
}
```
