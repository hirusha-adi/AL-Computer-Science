# Task 13.02

Write the declaration of a record type to store the details of a book: Title, Year of
publication, Price, ISBN.
Write the statements required to assign the values “Computer Science”, 2019, £44.95,
“9781108733755” to the fields respectively

```
TYPE BookDetails
    DECLARE title: STRING
    DECLARE year: INTEGER
    DECLARE price: REAL
    DECLARE isbn: STRING
ENDTYPE

DECLARE Book1: BookDetails

Book1.title <- "Computer Science"
Book1.year <- 2019
Book1.price <- 44.95
Book1.isbn <- “9781108733755”
```

# Task 13.03

Define two arrays, one for your friends’ names and one for their ages as shown in
Figure 13.02

```
DECLARE friendNames: ARRAY[0:19] OF STRING
DECLARE friendAges: ARRAY[0:19] OF INTEGER

FOR i <- 0 to 19
    OUTPUT "Name: "
    INPUT friendNames[i]
    OUTPUT "Age: "
    INPUT friendAges[i]
NEXT i
```

# Task 13.04


Use the algorithm in Worked Example 13.02 as a design pattern. Write an algorithm
using the arrays from Task 13.03 to search for a friend’s name and output their age.

```
DECLARE friendNames: ARRAY[0:19] OF STRING
DECLARE friendAges: ARRAY[0:19] OF INTEGER


OUTPUT "Name: "
INPUT checkName

found <- TRUE
i <- -1
maxIndex <- 19

REPEAT
    i <- i + 1
    IF friendNames[i] == checkName THEN
        FOUND <- TRUE
        foundIndex <- i
    ENDIF
    INPUT friendAges[i]
UNTIL FOUND = TRUE OR i >= 19

IF found = TRUE THEN
    OUTPUT "The age is: " friendAges[foundIndex]
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Friend Name not found"
ENDIF
```

# Task 13.05

Rewrite the algorithm in Worked Example 13.03 to sort the array elements into
descending order.

### Descending Order

```
n ← MaxIndex – 1
REPEAT
    NoMoreSwaps ← TRUE
    FOR j ← 0 TO n
        IF MyList[j] < MyList[j + 1]      // <--- this is changed
        THEN
            Temp ← MyList[j]
            MyList[j] ← MyList[j + 1]
            MyList[j + 1] ← Temp
            NoMoreSwaps ← FALSE
        ENDIF
    NEXT j
    n ← n – 1
UNTIL NoMoreSwaps = TRUE
```

### Ascending Order

```
n ← MaxIndex – 1
REPEAT
    NoMoreSwaps ← TRUE
    FOR j ← 0 TO n
        IF MyList[j] > MyList[j + 1]    // <--- this is changed
        THEN
            Temp ← MyList[j]
            MyList[j] ← MyList[j + 1]
            MyList[j + 1] ← Temp
            NoMoreSwaps ← FALSE
        ENDIF
    NEXT j
    n ← n – 1
UNTIL NoMoreSwaps = TRUE
```

# Task 13.06

1. Declare a 2D array to store the board data for the game Noughts and Crosses. The
   empty squares of the board are to be represented by a space. Player A’s counters
   are to be represented by “O”. Player B’s counters are to be represented by “X”.

2. Initialise the array to start with each square being empty.

3. Write a statement to represent player A placing their counter in the top left square.

4. Write a statement to represent player B placing their counter in the middle square.

```
DECLARE board: ARRAY[0:2,0:2] OF CHAR

FOR row <- 0 to 2
    FOR column <- 0 to 2
        board[row, column] = ' '
    NEXT column
NEXT row

board[0,0] = 'O'
board[1,1] = 'X'
```

or in Python

```python
board = [[' ', ' ', ' '],
         [' ', ' ', ' '],
         [' ', ' ', ' ']]

for row in range(3):
    for col in range(3):
        board[row][col] = ' '

board[0][0] = 'O'
board[1][1] = 'X'
```


# Task 13.07

1. Declare an array of BookType (see Task 13.02) for 200 books.

2. Set the first book’s details to the values given in Task 13.02.

```
TYPE BookDetails
    DECLARE title: STRING
    DECLARE year: INTEGER
    DECLARE price: REAL
    DECLARE isbn: STRING
ENDTYPE

DECLARE books: ARRAY[0:199] OF BookDetails

books[0].title <- "Computer Science"
books[0].year <- 2019
books[0].price <- 44.95
books[0].isbn <- “9781108733755”
```

# Task 13.08


1. Write pseudocode to save the array data from Task 13.06 to a text "file.txt".

- Python Implementation

```python
board = [[' ', ' ', ' '],
         [' ', ' ', ' '],
         [' ', ' ', ' ']]

for row in range(3):
    for col in range(3):
        board[row][col] = ' '

board[0][0] = 'O'
board[1][1] = 'X'

filename = 'board_data.txt'  # Specify the desired filename
with open(filename, 'w') as file:
    for row in board:
        file.write(' '.join(row) + '\n')

```

- Pseudocode Implementation

```
DECLARE board: ARRAY[0:2,0:2] OF CHAR

FOR row <- 0 TO 2
    FOR column <- 0 TO 2
        board[row, column] = ' '
    NEXT column
NEXT row

board[0,0] = 'O'
board[1,1] = 'X'

OPENFILE "file.txt" FOR WRITE

row <- 0
column <- 0
FOR row <- 0 TO 2
    FOR column <- 0 TO 2
        WRITEFILE ""file.txt".txt", board[row][column]
        IF column < len(board[row]) - 1
        THEN
            WRITEFILE "file.txt". ' '
        ENDIF
    NEXT column
    WRITEFILE "file.txt", '\n' // write a  new line to the "file.txt"
NEXT row
```

2. Write pseudocode to read the values stored in the text "file.txt" back into the board array

- Python Implementation

```python
def read_board_from_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        board = []
        for line in file:
            row = line.strip().split(' ')
            board.append(row)
        return board

filename = 'board_data.txt'  # specify the filename used to save the board data
board = read_board_from_file(filename)

# print and verify
for row in board:
    print(row)

```

- Pseudocode Implementation

```
do we have a .split() like function in pseudocode? 
```
