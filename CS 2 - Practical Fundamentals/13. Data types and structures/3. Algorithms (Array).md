# Linear Search

 - checking each element of an array in turn for a required value
 - time complexity is: `O(n)`

## How does it work?

1. iterate through the list
2. check if each element is equal to what we are searching for using a basic "IF-ELSE" conditional
3. if it matches, break the loop to stop searching

#### Pseudocode

```
MaxIndex ← 6
INPUT SearchValue
Found ← FALSE
Index ← –1

REPEAT
 	Index ← Index + 1
 	IF MyList[Index] = SearchValue
 	THEN
 		Found ← TRUE
 	ENDIF
UNTIL FOUND = TRUE OR Index >= MaxIndex

//
// display values (optional)
// ---------------------------
IF Found = TRUE
 THEN
 	OUTPUT "Value found at location: " Index
 ELSE
 	OUTPUT "Value not found"
ENDIF
```

#### Python Implementation

```python
MyList = [...]

MaxIndex = 6 # = len(MyList)
SearchValue = int(input("Enter the search value: "))
Found = False
Index = -1

while not Found and Index < MaxIndex:
    Index += 1
    if MyList[Index] == SearchValue:
        Found = True

if Found: print("Value found at location:", Index)
else: print("Value not found")
```

# Bubble Sort

- a sort method where adjacent pairs of values are compared and swapped until array is fully sorted
- time complexity is: `O(n^2)`

## How does it work?

1. Start with an unsorted list of elements.
2. Compare the first element with the second  lement.
3. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
4. Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat  he comparison and swapping process.
5. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list. At this point, the largest element will be in  its correct position at the end of the list.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the remaining unsorted portion of the list (excluding the last sorted element).
7. Keep repeating steps 2-6 until the entire list is sorted.

- The key idea behind bubble sort is that with each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles" to its correct position at the end of the list. By repeatedly going  through the list and comparing adjacent elements,  bubble sort gradually sorts the elements from the beginning to the end.

#### Pseudocode

```
n ← MaxIndex - 1
REPEAT
    NoMoreSwaps ← TRUE
    FOR j ← 0 TO n
        IF MyList[j] > MyList[j + 1]
        THEN
            Temp ← MyList[j]
            MyList[j] ← MyList[j + 1]
            MyList[j + 1] ← Temp
            NoMoreSwaps ← FALSE
        ENDIF
    NEXT j
    n ← n - 1
UNTIL NoMoreSwaps = TRUE
```

#### Python Implementation (while + for loops)

```python
def while_for_implentation(list_a):
    indexing_length = len(list_a) - 1  # SCan not apply comparision starting with last item of list (No item to right)
    sorted = False  # Create variable of sorted and set it equal to false

    while not sorted:  # Repeat until sorted = True
        sorted = True  # Break the while loop whenever we have gone through all the values

        for i in range(0, indexing_length):  # For every value in the list
            if list_a[i]:  # "Angled brackets not allowed in Youtube Description :( list_a[i+1]: #if value in list is greater than value directly to the right of it,
                sorted = False  # These values are unsorted
                list_a[i], list_a[i+1] = list_a[i+1], list_a[i]  # Switch these values
    return list_a  # Return our list "unsorted_list" which is not sorted.

```

#### Python Implementation (for + for loops 1)

```python
def for_for_1_implentation(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):

        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):

            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

    return arr
```

#### Python Implementation (for + for loops 2)

```python
def for_for_2_implentation(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements in reverse order
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):

        # Iterate from the beginning to the current position
        for j in range(i):

            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

    return arr
```
