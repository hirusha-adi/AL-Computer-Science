# Recovering from Data Loss
- Make full backups regularly
 - At least keep two generations of full backup kept in storage
 - Make incremental backups daily
- Freeze file store while data being copied for maximum stability
- Disk mirroring, or use RAID

# Restricting access to data
- Custom user access privileges levels
- Have Authorization (userâ€™s rights)

# Protecting data content
- Even if data gets stolen, if its unreadable, it will be useless (encrypt)
