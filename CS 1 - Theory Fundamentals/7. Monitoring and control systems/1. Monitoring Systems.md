# Monitoring Systems

- used to create a record of the condition of a system over a time period. 

- used to detect when a particular physical property of a system goes outside a setrange 
	- Eg: min->max cpu temperature range

## Sensors

- a hardware device that measures a property and transmits a value to a controlling computer as it has no intelligence

- Some sensors:
	Motion, pH (soil, water), humidity, pressure, 	temperature

- To measure temperature: use thermocouple -> output voltage with varying temperature

## Microprocessors / Microcontrollers

- Microprocessors or microcontrollers might be used to process if in range, etc..

- Has a real-time program running continuously. Simple IF-ELSE statement checks used
