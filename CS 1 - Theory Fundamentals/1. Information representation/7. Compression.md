# Lossless Compression

- Once decoded, recreates exactly the original file

1. ## Run Length Encoding

	- The same for bytes:
		- 01100110 01100110 01100110 01100110 
	- Can be replaced as:
		- 00000100 01100110
		- *(4x this byte)*

2. ## Huffman Encoding

	- Sequences of code are replaced by a single character
	- Most effective for sound as some values for 
		- eg: amplitude may repeat very often than others would

# Lossy Compression

- Information is lost in compression process and cannot be recovered
	- Eg: Removing unheard frequencies from sound files
      	- For images, use a color scheme with a reduced color depth to reduce file size
