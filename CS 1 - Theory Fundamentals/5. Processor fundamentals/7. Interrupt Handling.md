# Interruption Handling

## Introduction
- Different interrupts have different priorities. 
- Done due to: 
	- fatal error in a program 
	- hardware fault
	- I/O processing needs to begin
	- user interaction
	 - timer signal

## Handling an Interrupt:

- Registers are saved in memory for safety. 
- ISR program address is loaded into the program counter. 
- After executing ISR, further interrupts are checked, and the ISR is executed repeatedly if any. 
- If no further interrupts, registers are restored, and the original program is resumed.

### What is ISR 
- Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) program that manages interrupts
