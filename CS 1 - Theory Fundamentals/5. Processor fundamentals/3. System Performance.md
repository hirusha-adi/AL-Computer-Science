# Factors Contributing to System Performance

- The processor clock speed. 
- Modern processors are Multi-Core. 
- Each core is a separate processor. 
- Performance improves with an increasing number of cores.

- Cache memory (fastest component of the IAS)
- Performance improves with increased storage size + speed for the cache.

- Fastest access is obtained by having all or part of the cache on the CPU chip. 

# Word

- Small number of bytes that can be handled as a unit by the computer system. A word consists of a number of bytes and for any system the word length is defined.
	- number of bytes or
	- number of bits.

- Typical lengths: 16, 32 or 64 bits; that is, 2, 4 or 8 bytes, respectively. 

- influences the architecture design in the capacity of the components. 
- size of registers and bus widths to match the word length.
