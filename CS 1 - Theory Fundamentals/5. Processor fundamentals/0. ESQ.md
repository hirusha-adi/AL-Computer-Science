# Question 1

**a A processor has just one general-purpose register. Give the name of this register. [1]** 

- Accumulator

**b The memory address register (MAR) is a special-purpose register. State:i its function ii the type of data stored in it iii the register that supplies these data at the start of the fetch stage of the fetch–execute cycle.**

- Stores the address of a memory location or an I/O component which is about to have a value read from or written to

- Additional Information
	- The main function is to store the memory address of data or instructions that need to be accessed from the memory. The MAR holds the address that is sent to the memory to specify the location from which data or instructions are to be read or to be written to.

	- stores the memory addresses, which are typically expressed as binary values. They represent the locations in the computers memory where the desired data / instructions are stored. The MAR does not store the actual data or instructions but rather the address that points to their location in the memory.

	- During the fetch stage in the fetch-execute cycle, the instruction that is to be executed is fetched from memory. The register that supplies the address data to the MAR (Memory Address Register) at the start of the fetch stage is the PC (Program Counter). The PC holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched from the memory. This address is transferred to the MAR to fetch the corresponding instruction from the memory for execution.

**c The current instruction register (CIR) is another special-purpose register. State: i its function ii the type of data stored in it iii the register that supplies this data at the end of the fetch stage of the fetch–execute cycle.**

- Stores the current instruction while it is being decoded and executed

- Additional Information:
	- It's a special-purpose register in the CPU. It mainly stores the instruction that is currently being executed by the processor. The CIR holds the binary representation of the instruction fetched from memory during the fetch stage and is used by the processor to decode and execute the instruction.

	- The CIR stores the binary representation of the instruction that is currently being executed by the processor. This instruction is normally encoded into a specific format determined by the processor's ISA (instruction set architecture). The CIR holds the opcode and any associated operands or addressing modes required for execution of instructions.

	- At the end of the fetch stage of the fetch-execute cycle, the instruction fetched from memory is stored in the CIR. The register that supplies this instruction data to the CIR is typically the MDR (Memory Data Register), depending on what the architecture is. The MDR holds the instruction data after it has been fetched from memory and transfers it to the CIR for execution.

**d Explain three differences between the memory address register and the memory data register**

- Function: The memory address of data or instructions that are to be accessed or written to in the memory is stored in the Memory Address Register (MAR), which serves this purpose. It's used to provide the starting point for reading data or the destination for writing data.
The actual information that is read from or written to the memory is kept in the Memory Data Register (MDR), on the other hand. During memory operations, such as reading data from memory into the processor or writing data from the processor to memory, it temporarily stores the data.

- Data type: Memory addresses, which are  binary values indicating where data or instructions are located in the memory, are kept in the Memory Address Register (MAR). Instead than storing the data itself, it instead stores the address that directs users to the relevant location.
The Memory Data Register (MDR), in contrast, keeps track of the information that is actually read from or written to memory. The data being transmitted between the memory and the CPU is stored here in binary form.

- Fetch-Execute Cycle Usage:
The Memory Address Register (MAR) is used to store the address of the instruction to be fetched from memory during the fetch step of the fetch-execute cycle. It takes the address from the program counter or instruction pointer and sends it to the memory to retrieve the appropriate instruction.
The Memory Data Register (MDR) is used to store the data being transferred between the memory and the CPU during the execution phase of the fetch-execute cycle. It sends data to the memory during a writing operation or receives data from the memory following a read operation. Data transfer is made easier by the MDR's role as an interface between the memory and the processor.

# Question 2

**The system bus comprises three individual buses: the data bus, the address bus and the control bus.**
**a For each bus give a brief explanation of its use.**

- Address Bus
	- Carries an address- from MAR to memory controller or I/O controller

- Data Bus
	- Carries data (instruction, address or value)

- Control Bus
	- Transmits a signal from or to the Control Unit
	- Mainly carries timing signals at time intervals dictated by the clock cycle

- Additional Information:

	- Memory Address Register (MAR) to Memory Controller or Input/Output (I/O) Controller: Memory addresses are transferred over the address bus. It allows the CPU to indicate where data needs to be read from or written to in the memory or on I/O devices. The most amount of memory that the CPU can address depends on the address bus's width. For instance, a 16-bit address bus can address 65,536 bytes, or 64 KB, of memory.

	- Data is transferred between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices using the data bus. It contains a range of information, including commands, addresses, and real data values. The amount of data that can be transferred simultaneously depends on the data bus's width. A 32-bit data bus, for instance, can move 4 bytes of data in a single operation. Since the data bus is bidirectional, both read and write operations can be performed on it.

	- The control bus transports control signals throughout the computer system's many parts, especially between the CPU and other peripherals. In order to coordinate and manage the operation of numerous hardware components, it transmits signals from the control unit. Timing signals that align various components' operations with the clock cycle might be included in the control signals. Read-write operations, interrupt requests, bus requests, and bus grants are examples of other control signals. For the computer system to operate properly, the control bus is essential for controlling the data flow and coordinating the actions of many components.

**b Each bus has a defined bus width.** 

- **i State what determines the width of a bus. [1]**

	- number of parallel lines or wires that make up the bus.

	- Additional Information:

		- The number of bits that can be transmitted simultaneously is referred to as a bus' width. In most cases, the width is specified as a number of bits, such as 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, etc.

		- The width of a bus is determined by various factors, including the architecture and design of the computer system. 

		- Processor Architecture: The bus width is significantly influenced by the processor architecture employed in the computer system. Wider data buses may be necessary for processors with longer data paths and larger registers in order to transport data between the processor and memory or other devices effectively.

		- Memory System: The bus width is also influenced by the size of the memory system, which includes RAM and ROM. To maximize data transmission speeds, the data bus width is frequently created to coincide with the width of the memory system.

		- The processor's chosen instruction set architecture (ISA) may have an impact on the necessary bus width. Wider data buses may be needed for specific commands or processes to handle bigger data volumes or intricate calculations.

		- Performance and Bandwidth needs: The choice to employ broader buses can be influenced by the system's performance needs, such as the need for more bandwidth or quicker data transfer rates. Wider buses enable more data to be transported concurrently, enhancing system performance.

- **ii Explain which bus will have the least width. [2]**

	- The control bus has the least width. 

	- The control bus primarily carries control signals and timing signals between the control unit and various components of the computer system. These signals are often in the form of simple binary values (0 or 1) that indicate specific control actions or events. Since control signals typically require less data transmission compared to actual data or memory addresses, the control bus is usually narrower in terms of its width.

	- The width of the control bus depends on the complexity of the computer system and the number of control signals required for proper operation. It can vary but is generally narrower compared to the data bus and the address bus.

# Question 3


**The fetch stage of the fetch–decode–execute cycle can be represented by the following statements using register transfer notation:**
**MAR ← [PC]**
**PC ← [PC] + 1; MDR [[MAR]]**
**CIR ← [MDR]**
**a Explain the meaning of each statement. The explanation must include definitions of
the following items: MAR, PC, [ ], , MDR, [[ ]], CIR. [10]**


- `MAR`: 
	- Memory Address Register - holds the address of the memory location being 
	- Accessed. Used to specify memory location for reading / writing

- `PC`:
	- Program Counter (a special purpose register) - tracks the address of the next 
	- instruction to be fetched and executed. It’s incremented after each instruction is 
	- executed to point to the next instruction in the sequence

- 	`[]`:
	- Indicate contents of a memory location. Eg:
		-` [MAR]` tells the value stored in memory location specified by the MAR

- `MDR`:
	- Memory Data Register (a special purpose register) - used to hold the data read from  or to be written to memory. Acts as an intermediary between the CPU and the memory, by storying the data that is being transferred.

- `[[ ]]`:
	- Indicate the contents of the register. Eg:
	- `[[ MDR ]]` tells the value stored in MDR	

- `CIR`:
	- Current Instruction Register (a special purpose register) - holds the current 
	- Instruction being executed by the CPU. The instruction stored in the CIR is decoded  and executed by the control unit of the CPU


- `MAR ← [PC]`
	- "PC" = "program counter” keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction.
	- fetching process starts with transferring the value stored in PC to the "MAR" register.

- `PC ← [PC] + 1; MDR ← [[MAR]] `
	- Then, the value in PC is incremented by 1.
	- Simultaneously, the instruction at the memory address stored in MAR is fetched and loaded into the "MDR" register.

- `CIR ← [MDR]`
	- Finally, the instruction stored in MDR is transferred to the "CIR" register."

**b Explain the use of the address bus and the data bus for two of the statements. [4]**

- Address Bus: used to transfer contents of the Program Counter (CP) register to the MAR, specifying the memory location to be accessed.

- Data Bus: used to transfer the data from the memory location specified by the MAR to the MDR, allowing the CPU to obtain the fetched instruction.

- Additional Information:
	- MAR (Memory Address Register) is used to hold the address of the memory location being accessed. The address bus is utilized to transfer the contents of the PC  to the MAR. The address bus is a communication pathway that carries the memory address information from the CPU to the memory. It is used to specify the memory location from which the instruction needs to be fetched.

	- MDR (Memory Data Register) serves as an intermediary between the CPU and memory, holding the data read from or to be written to memory. During the fetch stage, the data bus is used to transfer the contents of the memory location specified by MAR to the MDR. Data bus is a communication pathway that carries the actual data between the CPU and the memory, By transferring the data from memory to the MDR via the data bus, the CPU can access and manipulate the fetched instruction.

# Question 4

**a Name and describe three buses used in the von Neumann model. [6]**

- Data Bus: carry data between CPU and memory, as well as CPU and IO (Input Output) devices. 

- Address Bus: used by CPU to specify memory location it wants to read or write from.It carries memory address information allowing the CPU to talk with the memory subsystem. 

- Control Bus: carries control signals that coordinate and synchronize activities of different components. 

- Additional Information:

	- Data Bus: It’s a bi-directional pathway for sending binary data, like instructions and data values. Width of the data bus determines the number of bits that can be transferred simultaneously. Eg: 32-bit data bus can transfer 32 bits of data in parallel

	- Address Bus: The width of the address bus tells the maximum addressable memory space. Eg: a 16-bit address bus can address up to 64KB of memory.

	- Control Bus: Some control signals are read, write, interrupt, clock, and reset, etc…. Ensures proper sequencing and timing of operations in the system. This is what enables the CPU to control the flow of data and overall management.

**b The sequence of operations shows, in register transfer notation, the fetch stage of the fetch-execute cycle.**
**1 MAR ← [PC]**
**2 PC ← [PC] + 1**
**3 MDR ← [[MAR]]**
**4 CIR ← [MDR]**
**[register] denotes contents of the specified register or memory location**
**step 1 above is read as “the contents of the Program Counter are copied to the Memory Address Register”**

- **i Describe what is happening at step 2] [1]**

	- The program counter is incremented by 1

	- Additional Information:
		- This is the register that stores the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed in the Fetch-Execute cycle. After the Program Counter is incremented, we are effectively pointing it to the next memory location where the next instruction resides. The current value stored in the PC is read, then 1 is added to that value. Then, the result is stored back in the PC, updating it to point to the next memory location. This makes sure that the instructions are fetched sequentially from memory, for program to execute in correct order,

- **ii Describe what is happening at step 3. [1]**
	
	- Gets the instruction or data stored in memory at the address specified by the MAR, and it temporarily holds that information in the MDR register for further processing.

- Additional Information:
	1. Contents of the MAR register are read (memory address that needs to be accessed)
	2. The "[[ ]]" tells that the value inside the MAR is treated as an address, which points to a specific location in the memory.
	3. The memory is accessed using the address stored in the MAR, and takes the data at that memory location.
	4. The data that has been retrieved is then loaded to the MDR.

- **iii Describe what is happening at step 4. [1]**

	- The instruction stored in the MDR is copied or loaded into the CIR

	- Additional Information:
		- CIR serves as a temporary storage for the currently fetched instruction. The fetched instruction is made available for the subsequent stages of the fetch-execute cycle.
		- After the instruction is stored in the CIR, it can be analyzed and decoded by the processor. The opcode and any operands associated with it within the instruction can be extracted from the CIR to determine the specific operation to be performed during the execution stage.

**c Describe what happens to the registers when the following instruction is executed: `LDD 35`   [2]**

- This would load the value 35 into a register ( normally called the destination register ). 

- Additional Information: 
	- Opcode "LDD": tells that a Load Direct operation is happening.
	- Here, the operand "35" tells the value that needs to be loaded into the register (mostly ACC), when this value is loaded, if there’s an existing previous value, it may be overwritten. 

**d**

- **i Explain what is meant by an interrupt. [2]**

	- A signal or event that temporarily pauses/suspends the normal execution of a program or process and diverts the attention of the processor to perform a specific task or handle a particular event.  It is used in computers to handle time-sensitive events, prioritize tasks, etc..

	- Additional Information:
		- Interrupts help in managing concurrent operations, enabling the system to utilize resources efficiently, and handle time-critical events. This supports multitasking, real time processing and in improving system responsiveness. 

		- When an interrupt occurs, these are usually taken place:
			1. Interrupt request
			2. Interrupt handling
			3. Interrupt service routine
			4. Interrupt return

- **ii Explain the actions of the processor when an interrupt is detected. [4]**
	- When an interrupt occurs, the program counter and other registers are saved in memory to ensure their safe storage. The interrupt handler - Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is then activated by loading its start address into the program counter. Once the ISR program is executed, it checks if there are any additional interrupts that need to be handled. If there are, the ISR program is repeatedly executed to handle them. However, if there are no further interrupts, the previously stored contents of the registers are restored to the CPU, and the originally running program is resumed.

	- Additional Information:
		1. The appropriate interrupt handler or Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) program is initiated by loading its start address into the program counter. 
		2. When the ISR program has been executed there is an immediate check to see if further interrupts need handling. 
		3. Further interrupts are dealt with by repeated execution of the ISR program. 
		4. If there are no further interrupts, the safely stored contents of the registers are restored to the CPU and the originally running program is resumed.

- The Program Counter (PC) is incremented 
- The instruction is copied to the Memory Data Register (MDR)  from the address held in the Memory Address Register (MAR) 
- The instruction from the Memory Data Register (MDR) is copied to the Current Instruction Register (CIR)

**b Use the statements A, B, C and D to complete the description of how the fetch-execute cycle handles an interrupt.**

| Letter | Represents |
| - | - |
| A | the address of the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is loaded to the Program Counter (PC)|
