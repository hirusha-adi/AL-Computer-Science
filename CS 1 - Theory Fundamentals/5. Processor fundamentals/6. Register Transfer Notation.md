# Register Transfer Notation

```
MAR ← [PC] 
PC ← [PC] + 1; MDR ← [[MAR]] 
CIR ← [MDR]
```

## `MAR ← [PC] `

- "PC" = "program counter” keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction.
- fetching process starts with transferring the value stored in PC to the "MAR" register.

## `PC ← [PC] + 1; MDR ← [[MAR]]`

- Then, the value in PC is incremented by 1.
- Simultaneously, the instruction at the memory address stored in MAR is fetched and loaded into the "MDR" register.

# `CIR ← [MDR]`

- Finally, the instruction stored in MDR is transferred to the "CIR" register.
