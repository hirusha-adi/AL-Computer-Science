# Program libraries

- Program libraries have subroutines or routines that do tasks for programmers. 
- It saves time.
- Stable code due to highly tested subroutines, reliable (eg: built in math functions)
- code cannot be run independently, it needs to be linked with the code for any subroutines. 
- but Each program using a routine requires its own copy, increasing the size of the executable.

# DLL

- When DLL routines are available, the executable needs less code to link to the separate routine stored in memory during program execution / runtime.
- Multiple processes can link same routine simultaneously, reducing ram and storage usage
- When DLL is updated, everything is updated
- If DLL corrupts, or hacked, all programs are affected
