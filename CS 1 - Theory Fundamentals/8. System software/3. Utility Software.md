# Hard Disk Formatter and Checker

- ## Why?
	- Remove existing data from used disk
	- Setup file system
	- Partition disk into logical drives if needed
	- Fix broken sectors
- Due to physical defects (mishandling, power loss, heavy movement), sectors are damaged: called ‘**bad sectors**’. 
- Formatter marks bad sectors and doesnt let the 
filesystem to use those bad sectors


# Hard Disk Defragmenter

- ## Why?
	- Optimize
	- make file reads and writes fast

## Fragmentation

- When files are used made, changed and deleted over time,
-  they become fragmented across the disk sectors. 
-  Now, the logical arrangement of data in sectors doesn’t allow  files to be stored in a contiguous block. 
-  it's called Fragmentation (Fragmented Data)
- Now, when the file is extended, it may use multiple sectors in a non sequential, non contiguous manner.
- this also increases read times

## DeFragmentation

- Defragmenter arranges these fragmented files into a contiguous block.
- Now, files can be read faster, and, as all the free space is also next to it contiguously 
- fast writes

# Backup Software

- Create scheduled backups
- Only create new backup file when a change is made

# File Compression

- To reduce disk space usage
- Easier to send emails

# Virus Checker

- Protect computer, scan all files + removable disks, 
- Update its DB to check for new viruses
