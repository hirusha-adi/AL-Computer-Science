# Compilers

- ## How?
	- Source code needed, data is optional
	- Compiler starts. 
	- Line is read
	- If error:
		- Errors are recorded
	- If no error:
		- Source code -> intermediate code
	- Repeat from read line
	- If error:
		- List errors and exit
	- If no error:
		- intermediate code -> object code

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| - | - |
| No source code shared in distribution | Insecure source code (viruses, RATs) |
| Once compiled, can run anywhere on same OS + arch (~ Cross Platform) | |
| Faster execution than interpreter | |
| Executable can be made to dist | |



# Interpreters

- ## How?
	- Need source code + data 
	- Interpreter starts
	- Line is read
	- If error: 
		- report and stop
	- If  no error: 
		- source code -> intermediate code (byte code)
		- Interpreter runs intermediate code
	- Repeat from read line

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| - | - |
| As program halts if error: it's easier for debugging | Delaying error discovery (like syntax) |
| Can detect and fix early errors | Need to share src code in distribution |
| Good debugging | Need development env. to run code |
| | One error can lead to many errors |
