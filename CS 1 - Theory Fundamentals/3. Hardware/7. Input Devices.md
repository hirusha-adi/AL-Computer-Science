# Keyboards

- Key press is converted to character code and transmitted to the cpu -> display to screen
- Keyboards has their own circuitry, microprocessor and ROM chip
<br>
- How it works?
	- Keys are in a matrix (like a chess board)
	- When a key is pressed, two wires in the axis touch
	- Microprocessor identifies this intersection (of closed circuit after touch)
	- It send the relevant character code as stored in ROM to the computer

 # Graphic Input
 
 ## Web Cam
 
 - stream video images to a computer

# Scanner

- reverses printing process, takes digital copy of hard copy
<br>
- How does it work?
	- Light moves from one end of the sheet to other
	- Reflected light from paper is directed by mirror and lenses to CCD
	- CCD (Charged Couple Device)
		- Has array of photosensitive cells creating proportional electrical response
		- Needs ADC to use in computer
