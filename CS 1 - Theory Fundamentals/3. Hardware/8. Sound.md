# Microphone

- A normal mic has a diaphragm that vibrates by incoming sound and created electrical signal
- A condenser microphone used capacitance change or piezoelectric crystals
- Needs ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter)

# Speaker

- Needs DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter)
- When current is changing, the coil moves back and forth, controlling diaphragm, making longitudinal sound waves
