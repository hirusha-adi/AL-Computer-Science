# Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)

- The 3D design is created using CAD Software  (Computer Aided Designing) and printed using a 3D printer.
- The nozzle squirts materials on to the printer bed making a physical layer repeatedly
- ( a gel containing chondrocyte cells and silicone infused with silver nanoparticles were the  other two â€˜inks )
