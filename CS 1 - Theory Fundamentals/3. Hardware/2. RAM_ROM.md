# RAM (Random Access Memory)

- any byte of data stored can be accessed without affecting the other bytes stored
- So, it’s also called Direct Access Memory
- **volatile:** doesn’t store data when the computer is turned off
- The system BIOS is stored in non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) in a flash erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) device
<br>
- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**
	- Made from capacitors that leak electricity. 
	- Regular recharge needed (in a matter of milliseconds)
	- Fewer electronic components per bit stored, cheap, slow, high density
	- Rarely, when DRAM is used for cache, it's called ‘embedded DRAM’

- **SRAM (Static RAM)**
	- Made from flip-flops that store data indefinitely while the computer is on
	- Short access time, fast, expensive, used for Cache (mostly)
	- Sometimes used for microprocessors with limited memory


# ROM (Read Only Memory)

- Random/Direct access, just like in ram
- Data is not lost when computer is switched off unlike RAM
- This is **non volatile**: stores data when computer is turned off
<br>
- **ROM (Read Only Memory)**
	- Installed when manufacturing
	- Chip must be replaced to change contents

- **PROM (Programmable ROM)**
	- Manufacturing sends empty chip, system builder installs program to chip
	- Once programmed, cannot be replaced, should replace the chip
	
- **EPROM (Erasable PROM)**
	- Data is erasable using UV Light for data to be written
	- Chip should be removed, erased, reprogrammed and reinstalled	

- **EEPROM (Electrically EPROM)**
	- Like EPROM, but erased using an electric signal
