- **Logic Proposition:** 
	- Statement that is either TRUE or FALSE
		- Eg:  Colombo is further north than Singapore

- **Problem statement:** 
	- an informal definition of an outcome which is dependent on one logic proposition or a combination of two or more logic propositions
		- Eg: The air-conditioning system is set to come on in an office only during working hours but also only if the temperature rises to above 25Â°C

- **Boolean Operators**:
	- **AND**: `A AND B is TRUE if A is TRUE and B is TRUE`
	- **OR**: `A OR B is TRUE if A is TRUE or B is TRUE`
	- **NOT**: `NOT A is TRUE if A is FALSE`

- **Logic expression**: 
	- logic propositions combined using Boolean operators, which may be equated to a defined outcome

- **Logic gate**: 
	- a component of a logic circuit that has an operation matching that of a Boolean operator
