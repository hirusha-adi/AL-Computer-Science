- Standardization adopted by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- Standard, traditional, fast, gigabit, 10 gigabit, 100 gigabit
- In original ethernet, transmission is done as broadcast, 
- So, every system receives the packet, now, that packet to check weather to accept it or not by checking what the destination ip address is
- **Collisions** occur when packets are sent by two clients at the same time causing corruption
- **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) was a fix for it

<br>

- The transmitter does the following: 
	1. Check voltage
	2. If activity is detected, wait a random time before re-checking. 
	3. If no activity is detected, start transmission.
	4. Continuously check for a collision. 
	5. If there is no collision, continue transmission. 
	6. If a collision is detected
		- stop sending packets,
		- send a jamming signal to warn end-stations,
		- after a random time, try again.

**BUT** now,
Switches controls transmission to end systems intelligently unlike hubs in **full duplex link**
So, no collision occurs
