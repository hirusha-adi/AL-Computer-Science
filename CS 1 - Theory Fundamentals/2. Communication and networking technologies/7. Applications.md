# Bit Streaming

- Media transmitted as byte stream is compressed to a sequence of bits - called a bit stream

- Your options are:
	1. Download and watch later
	2. View or listen on demand on any time chosen by the user(like playing a netflix video)
	3. Real time / Live transmission (like LiveTV or Twitch Streams)

**Video:** Good: *1.5 Mbps* / Bad: *300 Kbps*
**Audio:** Good: *128 Kbps* / Bad: *16 Kbps*

- Data sent into the buffer should be sent at a higher rate to allow unexpected delays.
- buffer size should be large so it never gets filled (affected by bandwidth).
- Video stream is reduced by compression due to bandwidth constraints.

- **Bit rate:** number of bits transmitted per second
